# Fullstack boilerplate

## Getting Started

### From the Github UI
See the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to use Github's feature to create a new repo from a template.

### From the command line

```
git clone https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/boilerplate-fullstack [your-project-name]
cd [your-project-name]
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
