Structure of how information will be displayed: 
Mercury
- order of the planet from the sun = 1

Atmosphere = thin exosphere composed mostly of oxygen sodium hydrogen and potassium
Climate = -180C to 430c 
Moons=  no moons
Exploration = nasas mariner 10 
Cool fact: only as wide as the Atlantic Ocean (18 mercuries fit into earth) 


Venus
- order of the planet from the sun = 2
date of discovery= 650 bc by the mayans, they used it to create a calendar

How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation) = one orbit takes 225 earth days.  one day on Venus takes 243 earth days! 1.6 * faster that of earths orbit and spins backwards

Surface geology (gas?) = terrestrial planet with an iron core

Atmosphere = The pressure is so intense it is like being under a kilometre of water
Climate= 482c
Moons = no moons
Exploration: the mariner 2 was one of the first missions to Venus in 1962
Cool fact: earths closes planetary neighbour- earths twin because it is similar in size and density  hottest planet 460c morning and evening star second brightest object in the sky besides the moon

Earth
- order of the planet from the sun = 3rd 
date of discovery = The name earth is atleast 1000 years old - germanic in origin, meaning ground
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation)
Surface geology (gas?) rocky planet with an iron-nickle core
Hydrology 
Atmosphere: 
Climate : -89C to 56C 
Moons : 1
Exploration:  
Cool fact: we live here, 70% of the palest surface is covered with water.

Moon 

Mars
-   order of the planet from the sun = 4th
date of discovery= 4000 years ago in Egypt
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation) = 24.6 hours -  one orbit takes 687 earth days
Surface geology (gas?) = terrestrial with iron nickel and sulfur core 
Atmosphere = the atmosphere is so thin  that the temperature at your feet can be 24 degrees and 0 degrees at your head 
Climate = -153 to 20 degrees Celsius 
Moons = 2 Phobos & deimos potato shaped
Exploration= the most studied planet. 
Cool fact: two rovers and 6 orbiting space crafts  home to the largest volcano in the solar system Olympus mons which is 3 times larger than Mt Everest. Used to have 




Jupiter
- order of the planet from the sun 5th 
date of discovery: 1610 galileo gelilei makes the first observations
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation): has the shortest day in the solar system- 10 hours orbit is 4333 days
Surface geology (gas?) : swirling gasses and liquids. No solid surfaces
Atmosphere : many layers of clouds - top layer is ammonia ice - mid layer ammonium hydrosulfide crystals - innermost water ice and vapour. 
Climate : an average of -110C
Moons : 53 moons 
Exploration : NASAâ€™s Juno space craft arrived in the Jobian system in 2016 studying the giant planet from orbit.  
Cool fact: has some of the largest moons in the solar system. Europa might be able to sustain life beneath its icy surface- more than twice as large as all the other planets combined. If earth was a 20c coin Jupiter would be the size of a basketball. Jupiter has a persistent storm called the great red spot which is twice the size of earth!




Saturn
- order of the planet from the sun: 6th 
date of discovery: Known since prehistoric times
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation) = 10759 earth days for a full orbit, 10.7hours is the length of day 
Surface geology (gas?) = gas giant

Atmosphere = primarily made up of hydrogen
Climate= average -139.15C
Moons = 53 confirmed moons
Exploration = Cassini arrived in 2004 and studied Saturn from orbit over 13 years before being plunged into the surface transforming it into an atmospheric probe in 2017 
Cool fact: gas giant with 7  rings of broken up comments asteroids and shattered moons, 2nd largest planet in the solar system

Uranus
-   order of the planet from the sun 7th 
date of discovery: 1781 by William Herschel who thought it was a comet or a star
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation)= 30687 earth days or 84 years to orbit the sun  day is 17 hours and 14 minutes 
Surface geology (gas?) = Ice Giant
Atmosphere = 80% hydrogen 
Climate = minimum temperature of - 224 
Moons = 27 moons 
Exploration = only one spacecraft has visited Neptune which took 9 years to reach 
Cool fact: one of two planets that rotate in a different direction.  Methane gives the signature blue colour 

Neptune
- order of the planet from the sun 8th 
date of discovery: 1612 it was incorrectly recorded as a fixed star by galileo - then predicted by Urbain Joseph in 1846 via mathematics 
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation) = takes 165 years to orbit the sun, day is 16 hours long
Surface geology (gas?) : Ice Giant
Atmosphere: 80% hydrogen 
Climate: average temperature on -201C
Moons : 14 
Exploration :1989 voyager 2  is the first and only spacecraft to study the planet. 
Cool facts: only planet not discoverable by the naked eye and was first predicted by mathematics before its discovery

Pluto
- order of the planet from the sun 9th - dwarf planet 
date of discovery: 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh
How long a day is (orbit speed and rotation) = 248 earth years for one year on Pluto, 153 hours for a single day
Surface geology (gas?) 
Atmosphere: nitrogen methane and carbon monoxide
Climate: average temperature on -232C
